# Final project 
A two screen application that has been styled and was created with React
Native. Firbase is incorporated so user can log in and out with Firebase
Authentication. 

There is a navigation across both screens for login and account. First
screen displays a login form where the user can create an account or
login. Once they login the user will be redirected to the account page.
The account page will display details of user and they can logout at
the bottom of the screen.
