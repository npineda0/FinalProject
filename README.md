# Final project 
A two screen application that has been styled and was created with React
Native. Firbase is incorporated so user can log in and out with Firebase
Authentication. 

There is a navigation for login and account page. First
screen displays a login form where the user can create an account or
login. Once they login the user will be redirected to the account page.
The account page will thank the user for signing in and from here,
the user can go back to the loginscreen or signout. When they press
the signout button, a modal will appear asking the user to confirm
to sign out or cancel.
